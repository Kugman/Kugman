# About Me

I am Efrat, a software engineer with deep experience in embedded systems, real time systems and C++. My work focuses on performance, reliability and low level problem solving. 
Over more than a decade in the industry I have designed and built systems that interact directly with hardware, optimize computation paths and handle strict timing requirements.

I enjoy challenges that demand precision thinking, from debugging complex race conditions to improving performance across different architectures. 
I care about clean design, predictable behavior and writing code that stands up to real world constraints. 
I am also interested in modern directions in computing, including GPU programming, parallel workloads and machine learning accelerators.

Outside of my professional work I spend a lot of time learning. 
I explore new technologies, study tools that catch my interest and build personal projects that help me grow as an engineer. 
I like experimenting, testing ideas and improving my technical understanding through hands on practice.

My GitHub is a place where I document this work. 
I share projects, try new approaches and keep track of what I learn. 
It reflects my curiosity, my practical mindset and my commitment to improving the way I build software.
