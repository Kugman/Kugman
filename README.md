## Hi there 👋


# About Me

I am Efrat, a software engineer with deep experience in embedded systems, real time systems and C++. I enjoy solving hard technical problems and building systems that push hardware to its limits. 
I spent more than a decade working on performance critical code and low level development. 
I also enjoy exploring new technologies, from GPU programming to machine learning accelerators.

Outside of work I explore new technologies, learn tools that interest me, and work on personal projects that sharpen my engineering skills. 
I like experimenting, testing ideas, and improving the way I build software.

My GitHub is a place where I experiment, learn, and share projects that reflect my curiosity and my drive to grow as an engineer.
